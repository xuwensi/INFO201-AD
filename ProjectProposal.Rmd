* 1.0 Introduction
  + 1.1 Problem Situation. <text>
  + 1.2 What is the problem? <Cars in the past have been extremely fuel inefficient and as green house gas is becoming an increasing concern in our world, which is leading to global warming, mass extinction etc. The technology in formula one has become increasingly innovative with the use of smaller, more efficient engine systems. This is shown through how lap times has been steadily decreasing while the displacement of f1 engines has also been slowly decreasing. The innovative technology used in formula 1 is also influencing the current road car industry.>

* 3.0 Possible data sets
Name: Formula 1 Race Data 
This dataset was updated to Kaggle.com by Chris G. on Nov 28th, 2017. It contains data about Formula one from 1950 through the 2017 season, consisting of tables describing constructors, race drivers, lap times, races, results of each race, and seasons. Chris G. declared that the dataset was downloaded from ergast.com at the conclusion of the 2017 season and was originally gathered and published by Chris Newell.
