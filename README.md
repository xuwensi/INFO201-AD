Formula 1 is one of the top racing shows in the country, which means that there are thousands of viewers. People watch these shows but seldom think about the risks associated with racing going hundreds of miles per hour. Every piece of the car and passing every protocol counts. It is extremely distressing to see a racer lose their life on live television, therefore having a website that condenses and presents all of the previous data and trends to hopefully help the direct stakeholders understand how to continuously prevent accidents from occurring. This project will focus on the variables that cause the decrease in the number of car crashes in the F1 races over the years.
