This project uses Formula One Race datasets and aims to analyze the energy systems used in F1 cars and the lowering of carbon emissions through innovative automotive designs. This is shown in the dataset through how lap times have been steadily decreasing while the displacement of f1 engines has also been slowly decreasing. The innovative technology used in formula 1 is also influencing the current road car industry.
